# Archetype_Rail_Carriage_Clamp_Mod
A User Mod to the Armchair Heavy Industries Archetype Rail Carriage mount to clamp 9mm belts directly 

This replaces the universal belt clip with belt clamps that restrain the belt directly to the rail carriage itself as well as providing a excess belt loop location

I personally found that the stock belt mount lacked the ability to ensure that both Gates GT 9mm belt pretension slack for mods like Monolith, which has very limited tension range and belt tensioning for future Gates GT3 9mm belts could be set with a strong confidence of not slipping.

During testing this style of belt clamp was tested up to 40kg of weight hanging from the belts with no slip occuring with the test rail carriage mount plastic failing during a shock loading of that 40kg before any belt slip was obeserved.

The current version only supports MGN12H but this may expand to MGN9H in the future
